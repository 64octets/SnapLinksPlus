<p><b>Clay pot cooking</b> is a
	<a title="Chinese cooking techniques" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cooking_techniques">technique</a> of
	<a title="Cooking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking">cooking</a> <a title="Food" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food">food</a> in an unglazed clay
	pot which has been soaked in <a title="Water" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</a> so as to release
	<a title="Steam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam">steam</a> during the cooking process. This technique has a long history,
	stretching back at least to ancient <a title="Ancient Rome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Roman</a> times, and is
	commonly used in several cuisines in Africa, Europe and Southeast and East Asia.</p>
<h2>
	<span id="Cooking_techniques" class="mw-headline">Cooking techniques</span></h2>

<p>Typically, an unglazed clay pot is submerged for 15 to 30 minutes to absorb water before cooking, then filled with
	the food and placed into an <a title="Oven" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven">oven</a>. The walls of the pot help to diffuse the
	<a title="Heat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat">heat</a>, and as the pot warms it releases the water as steam.</p>

<p>The food inside the clay pot loses little of its <a title="Moisture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture">moisture</a> because it is
	surrounded by steam, creating a tender, flavorful <a title="Recipe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe">dish</a>. The evaporation of
	the water prevents burning so long as the pot is not allowed to heat until it is completely dry. Because no oil
	needs to be added with this cooking technique, food cooked in a clay pot may be lower in fat compared with food
	prepared by other methods such as <a title="Sautéing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing">sautéing</a> or
	<a title="Frying" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frying">frying</a>. And unlike <a title="Boiling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling">boiling</a>,
	nutrients are not leached out into the water.</p>

<p>Because of the heat lost to the <a title="Evaporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation">evaporation</a> of water, clay pot
	cooking requires lower oven temperature and longer cooking times than traditional
	<a title="Roasting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasting">roasting</a> with dry heat. Clay pots may be cleaned by scrubbing them
	with salt; <a title="Soap" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap">soaps</a> or <a title="Detergent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent">detergents</a>
	should not be used, because the clay may absorb them.</p>

	<span id="Ethiopia" class="mw-headline">Ethiopia</span></h2>

<p>In ancient Ethiopia, all cooking was done with hand made clay pots made for different types of food. Today in most
	rural areas and in some urban homes, cooking is done with traditional clay pots because of the high price of regular
	metal pots. Some urban homes however use traditional clay pots believing that the food tastes better if cooked with
	a clay pot than a metal pot.</p>
