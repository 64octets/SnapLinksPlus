# Snap Links Plus

New Website Online: [Snap Links v3](http://cpriest.github.io/SnapLinksPlus/)

Latest Beta (unsigned, **testers welcomed!!**) [Snap Links v3.1.0b2](https://github.com/cpriest/SnapLinksPlus/raw/master/dist/SnapLinks-3.1.0b2.xpi)

Snap Links Plus is being re-written from the ground up to be a [Web Extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

The reasons behind this are simple, [electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) is coming, [XUL/XPCOM are on the way out and chrome style plugins are the new standard](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/), which also happens to be both restartless and compatible with chrome, opera and in the future, other browsers.

Personally I have put off fixing Snap Links Plus because I have not had the time, nor desire to bite off the large project.  With v3 we are starting anew with no legacy code.  This means some features may no longer exist while other new features are written.

I wholly encourage forking this project and submitting code and patches for inclusion.

**It is doubtful that all v2 features will be rewritten for v3 without the help of others**.

Great progress has been made with v3, the next release due soon will have the majority of the v2 features, **but without a configuration panel.  The next release will have configurable options.**

Please see [Dev Notes](DevNotes.md) for the latest development status.

## Known Issues & Some Planned Features

 * Open in New Tabs/New Windows/Tabs In New Window
 * Releasing the mouse button while holding down shift causes Context Menu to appear ([unfixable at the moment](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692139)) - Plan is to have alternative method to bypass Greatest Font Size Filter
