# Bugs
1. [Issue #91](https://github.com/cpriest/SnapLinksPlus/issues/91)-1 - Width of selection box independent of zoom factor... possibly doable with SVG since it has it's own coordinate system??

# Plans

- Add selection of and .click()ing of highlighted buttons
- Add "greatest of types" activation.  5 buttons & 1 link selected, only buttons will be .click()ed
- Add size-of-text minification (select greatest size font links unless shift is held)
- Add checking/unchecking of checkboxes
- Add Options GUI
