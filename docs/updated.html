			<h3>New Version Installed</h3>

			<p>Your version of Snap Links has just been updated, here is what is new:</p>

			<h4>v3.1.1</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A few configuration options now available
					<ul>
						<li>Enable/Disable switching focus to new tab.</li>
						<li>Show/Hide the number of selected links.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>A personal note</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Snap Links is something I work on in my free time.  I work a more than full time job and support my wonderful wife and two children.
				</p>
				<p><em>Some people think they deserve this <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and when it is not to their liking they complain, post bad reviews and more
					or less act like entitled brats.</em>
				</p>
				<p>This add-on already does everything <strong>I personally</strong> want it to do, I work to add additional features that others request out of charity of my
					own limited free time.</p>
				<p>I do not appreciate the criticism and it is not motivating, please stop or I may just stop development and take the add-on down.</p>
				<p><strong>I would also like to call special attention to other people who have contributed their time with code, support and documentation among other
					things.</strong>  Without these people I would have already abandoned development.</p>
				<p>In no particular order, they are:</p>

						<li>@FatOrangutan</li>
						<li>@AstrodogX</li>
						<li>@yfdyh000</li>
